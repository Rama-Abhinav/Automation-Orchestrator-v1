Create a Logger class:

    Attributes:

        file_path (where logs are stored)

        log_level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

    Methods:

        log(message, level) → Writes to file only if level >= current log_level
            log(message, level) method

                This method does three things:

                > Checks if the message level is allowed

                > Formats the message

                > Writes it to the file

        read_logs() → Reads and prints existing logs
            This method:

                > Opens the same file

                > Reads stored logs

                > Outputs them

    Constructor (__init__)

        > Initialize file path and log level

        > Validate inputs

            The constructor answers one question:

                “What must be true for this object to exist safely?”

                    For the Logger:

                    File path must be a valid string

                    Log level must be a known level

Sample Input :-
logger = Logger("logs/automation.log", "INFO")

logger.log("Automation started", "INFO")
logger.log("API rate limit nearing", "WARNING")
logger.log("API authentication failed", "ERROR")

logger.read_logs()
